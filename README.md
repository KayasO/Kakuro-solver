# Kakuro solver

This is my take on a Kakuro desktop application using React and Electron.

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm install

To install all dependencies.

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Electron will start a chromium thread and open http://localhost:3000.
Optionally you can open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
